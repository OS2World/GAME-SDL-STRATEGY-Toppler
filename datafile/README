Dear brave soul,

so you have decided to try to build the tower toppler datafile on your
own. To make this possible here are a few hints.

1. Software requirements

- gimp with script-fu support
- blender
- povray
- make
- c compiler
- libz and libpng

2. manual tasks

- you have to create the blender images on your own. The repository
only contains the blender filed. Put the images into a subdirectory
called "render" in the submarine and fish subdirectory. There must be
72 images with submarines and 2 times 32 images inside the fish
directory. All of them tga files.

- adapt the makefile so that the programs have the right name

- cross your fingers that it works

- type "make"

3. automatic tasks

The makefile should now generate all that is necessary to build the
datafile. The images should be renderes and color reduced and
compressed into the datafile. You should just hope that it works.

Good luck

Andreas
